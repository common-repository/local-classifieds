Free classifieds system for your local needs, works with any WordPress template.

== Description ==

Free classifieds system for your local needs, works with any WordPress template and adapts to your current website.

I don't want to transform an entire site in a classifieds ads website, I just want to add classifieds service to my existing customers.
To satisfy my requirements  I made this simple plugin. It adds 2 pages one for listing and one for adding.
In the next versions it will be translated into more languages, you can add your own categories and it will allow pictures.
I want to do a PRO version to allow promoting an existing ad and online payment module.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/local-classifieds` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. After installation the plugin will generate two pages one for listing and one for adding.
4. You can add newly generated pages to your main menu, or side bar menu.
